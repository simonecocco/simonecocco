# Welcome to my GitHub README!

## Something about me
My name is Simone, I currently live in Sardinia (Italy) and I've passionate about programming since I first discovered it about 10 years ago.

Currently I'm working at [IMQ Intuity](https://www.intuity.it/) as a Software Security Consultant, a role I started in June 2024.

## My skills
I am dedicated to achieving my goals, understanding that success requires sacrifice and hard work. To that end, I practice and improve both my soft and hard skills daily.

For years, I've worked on Java development, particularly on the Android platform. I successully passed the [CyberChallenge](https://cyberchallenge.it/) selections using Java.

During the three-month training-program, I developed skills in other languages such as C, Python, and Ruby. For the CyberChallenge finals my objective was to create tools to simplify the service managenent.

I continue to develop and maintain those tools, including:
- [Patcher](https://github.com/simonecocco/patcher), a script to manage patch application on servers running services with Docker Composer;
- Mirto, an AI traffic analyzer (the project is now owned by the organization for which it was developed);
- IPTABLES manager with a human-to-tables translator.

To stay sharp, I enjoy tackling coding challenges on platform like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/simonecocco/), [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/simonecocco), and [Advent of Code](https://github.com/simonecocco/Advent-of-Code).

Currently, I am learning the Zig language, as I find its syntax and interoperability with C to be fascineting.

## My philosophy
In all my projects, I strive for efficiency and clean code.
